http://localhost:8080/myapp/FirstServ


whenever u make any changes in servlet source code

	1) compile servlet class
	2) save web.xml 
	3) refresh the browser







when u say

http://localhost:8080/myapp/FirstServ , for the first time,

what exactly happens

1) web container opens ur DD (web.xml)
2) it searches the url-pattern by the name "/FirstServ"
3) from url-pattern it finds out servlet-name .
4) from servlet-name, it finds out servlet-class.
5) once it gets the name of servlet-class, it tries to find out that .class file in "classes" folder of "myapp"
6)now it loads "FirstServ.class"
7) instantiate "FirstServ" by invoking its "public no-arg constructor".
8) it will invoke "init" method.
9) thread is created or retrieved from thread pool.
10) HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse are created.
11) service() method is called.
	service() method checks whether request is "get" or "post". if it is "get" service() method invokes "doGet()" and if it is "post" it invokes "doPost()"

since we are running servlet directly it is "get" request , so service() method will call "doGet()" which we have overridden.

	Imp. note:- when u refresh above link, i.e. for subsequent requests ( without makings changes in source code)

		9)  10) and 11) steps will be performed.
