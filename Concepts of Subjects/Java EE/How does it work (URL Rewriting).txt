Normally container stores session id inside cookie.

when we use following statement:

out.println("<a href=\"" +res.encodeURL("Second")+ "\">click Go to second servlet</a>");

with this statement now container will not only add session id to the cookie but also append it at the end of your URL.

now even if client does not accept cookie, session id will go to server along with URL. 
 When the user clicks that "enhanced" link, the request goes to the container with that extra bit on the end
 ( http://localhost:8080/myapp2/Second;jsessionid=4721261C3AF63C8625475DD090A7CC5A ), and the Container simply strips off 
the extra part of the request URL ( jsessionid=4721261C3AF63C8625475DD090A7CC5A ) and uses to find the matching session.

URL Rewriting is the way to ensure that session mechanism will always works irrespective of whether client browser accepts or rejects cookies.
