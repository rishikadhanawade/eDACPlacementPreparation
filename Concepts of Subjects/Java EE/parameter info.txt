parameters are used to send some kind of information to the servlet.	

	types of parameters passed to servlet

1) request
2) init or config
3) context

request:- these parameters are limited to only a particular request
init or config :- these parameters are shared by all the requests to a particular servlet
context :- these parameters are shared by all the servlets in that particular context (e.g. myapp)

request parameters are automatically set in the request.
init and context parameters need to be explicitly set in the DD.

request parameter can be read by the method "getParameter()".

init or config and context parameters can be read by the method "getInitParameter()".


in order to read request parameter, you need to use "HttpServletRequest".

in order to read init or config parameter, you need to use "ServletConfig" which is one per servlet.

in order to read context parameter, you need to use "ServletContext" which is one per context.
