Cookies are used to store information.

They can store only textual information ( no java objects)

Cookies can be rejected by client browser ( so that's the risk of using Cookies in order to store information)


Cookies are always added inside response and retrieved from request.

getServletContext().getInitParameter("database");

getServletContext()
	gives us ServletContext which is one per web app.
it is used to read context parameter/s.
in case of redirect
a) requests are different i.e. one request to "RedirectingServ" and another to "RedirectedServ".
b) since a fresh request needs to be passed to another web component , it is slow.
c) client knows which web component has given the response.
d) redirect can go beyond a server. i.e. u might redirect to say "www.gmail.com" etc.

in case of forward

a) request is same, it is just forwarded to another servlet/jsp.
b) since request is just forwarded it is faster than redirect.
c) client does not know which web component has given the response.
d) forward cannot go beyond a server.





ServletContext sc=getServletContext();
			RequestDispatcher rd=sc.getRequestDispatcher("/ForwardedServ");

		or


			RequestDispatcher rd=request.getRequestDispatcher("ForwardedServ");


RequestDispatcher created with "request" can be used within same "web application" i.e. project

RequestDispatcher created with "ServletContext" can go beyond the "web application" i.e. project.
when you write servlet, for defining one time activity we have 2 options:

constructor and init(ServletConfig).

so which is better?

init , because inside constructor ServletConfig is not available.

log.html accepts name and age from user. control is passed to "HiddenServ1" which collects those values stores them in "hidden fields" and pass it across "HiddenServ2" servlet.









cookies are set inside "response" and retrieved from "request".

drawback of custom cookies :

a) cookies can store only textual data and not java objects.
b) cookies can be disabled on client side.
